# vimeoslackbot
Tiny bot to add metadata to vimeo links

Create a new slackbot and add it to whichever channels you want it to listen to. 

Enter your bot's secret token and run the server `node index`.

That's it, anytime anyone shares a vimeo link, the bot will reply with the video's metadata if it finds any.
